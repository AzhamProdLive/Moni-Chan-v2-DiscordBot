#Editing responses
After you've sent an initial response, you may want to edit that response for various reasons. This can be achieved with the ChatInputCommandInteraction#editReply() method:

WARNING

After the initial response, an interaction token is valid for 15 minutes, so this is the timeframe in which you can edit the response and send follow-up messages. You also cannot edit the ephemeral state of a message, so ensure that your first response sets this correctly.

const wait = require('node:timers/promises').setTimeout;

client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

	if (interaction.commandName === 'ping') {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
		await wait(2000);
		await interaction.editReply('Pong again!');
	}
});
